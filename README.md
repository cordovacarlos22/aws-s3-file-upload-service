File Upload with Node.js, Multer, AWS S3, and MVC Architecture

This project demonstrates how to implement file upload functionality using Node.js, Multer, and AWS S3 while following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. The repository serves as a structured learning resource for building scalable backend applications with clean code organization and cloud integration.

Features:

	•	Node.js backend designed with the MVC architecture for better code maintainability and scalability.
	•	Multer middleware for handling file uploads in an Express application.
	•	Integration with AWS S3 for storing uploaded files securely in the cloud.
	•	Controller: Manages file upload logic and communication between the model and view.
	•	Model: Handles data validation and interaction with AWS S3.
	•	View: Provides responses for successful uploads or errors.

Learning Objectives:

	•	Understand the implementation of the MVC architecture in backend development.
	•	Learn how to configure and use Multer for file handling in Express applications.
	•	Gain hands-on experience with AWS S3 for cloud storage.
	•	Build scalable and well-organized backend systems.

This repository is a practical starting point for developers aiming to explore cloud storage integration and best practices in backend application design.
